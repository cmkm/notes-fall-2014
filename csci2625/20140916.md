Test 1 - Thursday, 18 Sept  
Tables provided: 
- Table 6, section 1.3
- Table 1, section 6

An ordered pair can be written as (a, b) = {a, {a, b}}

**2.3 Set Functions**

disjoint - two sets are disjoint (unjoined) iff their intersection is empty. 

difference - the difference of two sets is the set of all elements in A 
    but not in B. 

    A = {1, 2, 3}
    B = {3, 4, 5}
    A - B = {1, 2}

complement - U - A where U is the universal set.

**Propositional logic and set theory equivalences**
