Show that if x is a nonzero rational number, then there is aunique rational 
    number y such that xy = 2.

    Proof, part 1
        1. x = a/b, for integers a and b with b != 0
        2. y = 2b/a - note a != 0 by hypothesis
        3. xy = (a/b)(2b/a) = 2

        Thus showing that there is at least one y such that xy = 2.

    Proof, part 2 (show y is unique)
        1. Let z be any rational number such that xz = 2
        2. xz = a, thus xz = xy (because of part 1)
        3. and z = y

Proof by Resolution
    
    (p ^ q) v r and (r -> s) imply p v s
             LHS               ->   RHS

    LHS = ((p ^ q) v r) ^ (r -> s)
        = ((p ^ q) v r) ^ (!r v s)
        = (p ^ q) v s
        => p v s
