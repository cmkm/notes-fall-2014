Predicate logic

    Ex: let U = R, the real numbers

    P(x,y): xy = 0

    VxVyP(x,y) false
    VxEyP(x,y) true
    ExVyP(x,y) true
    ExEyP(x,y) true

    The only one that is false is the first one. Suppose P(x,y) is the predicate 
        x/y=1. 

    V = for all (universal quantifier)
    E = there exists

    Propositional logic is a subset of predicate logic.

    In the domain of all real numbers, 
        VxVy(x/y = 1) false
        VxEy(x/y = 1) false
        ^ zero can't be divided by anything to equal 1


Rules of Inference for Quantified Statements
    Universal instantiation
        VxP(x), qed P(c) true for abritrary c

    Universal generalization
        P(c) for arbitrary c, qed VxP(x)

    Existential instantiation
        ExP(x), qed P(c) for some element c

    Existential generalization
        P(c) for some element c, qed ExP(x)
