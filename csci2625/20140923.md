Proof by contradiction

Let r be a nonzero rational number and i be an irrational number (assume 
hypothesis). 

Assume (for purpose of contradiction) that r * i is rational. 

Thus r * i = p / q for integers p and q, q ≠ 0. 

Thus, i = p / q * r because r ≠ 0 gives denominator ≠ 0. 

Hence i is rational. 

Thus r * i is not rational, hence it is irrational.
