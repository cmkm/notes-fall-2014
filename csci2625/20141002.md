Transitive closures

M = set of one hop paths
M^2 = set of two hop paths
M^3 = " three
M^4 = " four

M^2 = | 0100 |   | 0100 |    | 0010 |
      | 0010 | x | 0010 | =  | 0001 |
      | 0001 |   | 0001 |    | 0000 |
      | 0000 |   | 0000 |    | 0000 |

Element by element multiplication, then sum. M\* = M ∨ M2 ∨ M3 ∨ M4

R (.) S = "or of the ands" - sum of products

M = "is child of" 
S = "is sister of" 

Charles is child of Elizabeth
Elizabeth is sister of Margaret

This is not transitive. 

Charles M ; S Margaret
