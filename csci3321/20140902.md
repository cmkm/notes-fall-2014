software architecture = a set of high-level decisions that define key 
    elements and their relationships. Made early, hard to modify later. 
    Not a phase of development. 

Architecture focuses on non-functional requirements, design on implementing 
    functional requirements. 

MVC architecture
    1. model and view do not communicate directly
    2. view does not do business ("domain") logic
