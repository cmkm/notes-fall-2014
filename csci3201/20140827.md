Complement of a function
    Given a function f1 = !xy!z + !x!yz

    Its complement, !f1 = !(!xy!z + !x!yz)

    By De Morgan's, !f1 = (x + !y + z) . (x + y + !z)

Dual of a function
    With the same function f1, the dual is 
        (!x + y + !z) . (!x + !y + z)

You can get to the complement by taking the dual and inverting 
    the variables, or by applying De Morgan's

f2 = x(!y!z + yz) - find dual and complement

    dual
    x + (!y + !z . y + z)

    complement
    !x + (y + z . !y + !z)

Minterm
    f = !x!yz + !xy!z + x!yz + xyz
    ^ this is a sum or products

    Minterms are the values of x, y, and z that make the 
        function evaluate to true. 

    Let x be the msb (most significant bit) and let z be the lsb.

    f = sigma m (1, 2, 5, 7) <- the decimal values of the values 
        in each term that make the function true

Maxterm
    Maxterms are the values of x, y, and z that make the fn 
        eval to false.

    f = pi M (0, 3, 4, 6)
      = (x + y + z) . (x + !y + !z) . (!x + y + z) 
            + (!x + !y + z)
      ^ this is a product of sums
