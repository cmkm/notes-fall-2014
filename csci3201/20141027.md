*Major Classes of Sequential Machines*
# Counter - synchronous
# Controller - asynchronous
# Sequence recognition - asynchronous

Recall Mealy model vs Moore model: 
- *Mealy model* - output depends on an input value and the state
- *Moore model* - output depends only on the state

Sequence Recognition
====================
Example sequence (bit stream): 10110101

An example pattern, in this case 1011, would result in an output value of 1. 

(See design reference on pp 240-241.)

*Problem 5b from pretest final*
Develop only the state diagram for a sequence recognizer as either a Mealy or 
a Moore state machine for the following binary sequence: 01101. Show two 
sample sequences on the state machine diagram. 

# *State diagram*
## Assume the sequence you're looking for is the input you're given. 
## Add 'wrong' inputs. 
## After valid sequence: if 0, go to first state; if 1, go to third state. 
## Can do away with the idle state. 

*HW due Wed:* D flipflop implementation of this, from state diagram to circuit.
