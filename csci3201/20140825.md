Boolean Algebra
    Basic operators: 
        + (OR)
        . (AND)
        _ (NOT)

    Table 2.3 from textbook: Basic Identities
        OR
        x + 0  = x
        x + 1  = 1
        x + x  = x
        x + !x = 1
        
        AND
        x . 1  = x
        x . 0  = 0
        x . x  = x
        x . !x = 0 

        !(!x)  = x

        x + y = y + x
        x . y = y . x

        COMMUTATIVE
        x + (y + z) = (x + y) + z
        
        ASSOCIATIVE
        x . (y . z) = (x . y) . z

        DISTRIBUTIVE
        x . (y + z) = (x . y) + (x . z)
        x + (y . z) = (x + y) . (x + z)
        
        DE MORGAN'S
        (invert vars and operators)
        !(x + y) = !x . !y
        !(x . y) = !x + !y

    Boolean function f = !xyz + !xy!z + xz - can this expression be 
    simplified using the identities above? 

    !xy is a common component, so that can be broken out: 
    f = !xy(z + !z) + xz
    
    (z + !z) can be simplified to 1:
    f = !xy + xz
    
    x --- |     |
    y --- |     | -> f
    z --- |     | 

    Simpler expression = fewer gates

    Ex: simplify this expression: 
    ab!c + b!c!d + bc + !cd = b + !cd
    (this is 2-3.a on the homework sheet)

    step 1: 
        b(a!c + !c!d + c) + !cd

    step 2: 
        b(!c(a + !d) + c) + !cd

    step 3: 
        ?
