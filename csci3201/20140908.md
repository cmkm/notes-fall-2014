Inverted and gate = NAND
Inverted or gate = NOR

XOR - exclusive OR, combination of all three. (!AB + A!B)
    Useful to tell if you have an odd number of 1s in input. Good 
    for error checking.

ch3: Combinational logic design

So far we've had individual functions F and G and how to express those in the 
    simplest manner possible. 

Textbook gives 5 step algorithm for design:
    1. specification
        What does it do? Inputs & outputs?
    2. formulation
        Derive truth table, then Boolean expression. 
    3. optimisation
        Two-level and multi-level optimisation
    4. technology mapping
        Use most current technology to implement circuit
        Logic diagram or net list
    5. verification
        Testing correctness of design & implementation

Ex 1.
    BCD -> Excess-3

    1. specification

        BCD = binary coded decimal, [0-9] 4-bits

        Excess 3 means add 3, 4-bits [3-12]

        A | BCD to | W 
        B | excess | X
        C |   3    | Y
        D |        | Z

    2. formulation

            in    out
            ABCD | WXYZ
            ___________
            0000 | 0011
    [0-9]   0001 | 0100 [3-12]
            ... |  ...
            1000 | 1011
            1001 | 1100

        Need 4 k-maps - one for each output. 

Ex 3-2, pg 109
    10-row truth table (0-9). 7 k-maps.

    HOMEWORK: do the truth table and k-maps and optimisation. Due Wednesday, 10/9.

    The truth table will specify the 1s for each output. 

    Don't-cares: sigma m(10..15)
