Suppose a set of semantic rules is given: 
# For each subject, each student of the subject is taught by only one teacher. 
# Each teacher teaches only one subject. 
# Each subject is taught by several teachers. 


# Entities: subject, student, teacher
  Attributes: none
  Names: n/a
  Identifier: subject name (assumed unique), J
              student name, S
              teacher name, T
  FD: J, S → T

# Entities: teacher, subject
  Attributes: none
  Names: n/a
  Identifier: T, J
  FD: T → J

# (No FD due to multivalue dependency.)

This relation is already in 1NF, because every attribute is simple. 

It is also in 2NF and 3NF.

(See paper notes.)

Deletion anomaly caused. 

Next normal form - BCNF (Boyce-Codd normal form) 

BCNF
----

A relation is in BCNF if every determinant is a candidate key. A determinant 
is the left side of a functional dependency. 

We would break the above relation down in this way: 

R1 = T → J
R2 = S, T → ø

The visual key to determining that a relation is not in BCNF is a non-key 
attribute pointing to a key. 

R2 would be called an *all key relation*. All attributes in this relation 
make the key. There's FD but the right side is empty. 

A relation does NOT need to be in 1NF, 2NF, or 3NF to be in BCNF. You can jump 
directly to it. 

Next time: 4NF.
