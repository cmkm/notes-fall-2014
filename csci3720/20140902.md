Relational data languages

    There are several categories of relational data languages. 
        1. Relational algebra oriented data languages
        2. Mapping oriented data languages
        3. Graphical oriented data languages
        4. Relational calculus oriented data languages

    Two categories: domain and tuple oriented. 

    We will be concentrating on #1 before design of relational data model. 

    Relational algebra oriented data languages
        Uses operations which are good at manipulating sets. Two groups of 
            instructions: 
            1. traditional operators
                a. union
                    Relation R1 includes attributes A, B, C. 
                    Relation R2 includes attributes D, E, F. 
                    R1 union R2 = R3
                    Relation R3 has attributes X, Y, Z with all attribute 
                        values.
                    May result in duplicate tuples, which should be removed by 
                        DBMS.
                    
                    Conditions for union (Conditions for being union-compatible)
                    1. Corresponding attributes in R1 and R2 must come from 
                        the same domain. 
                    2. The number of attributes in both relations must be the 
                        same. 
                
                b. intersection
                    R1 intersect R2 = R4
                    (all tuples in common)

                    Relations must be union-compatible to perform intersection. 
                
                c. subtract / minus
                    R1 minus R2 = R5

                    Result is all tuples in R1 that you don't have in R2.
                
                    Must be union-compatible.

                d. product / times
                    R1 times R2 = R7
                    
                    Result is the Cartesian product of these two relations. 

                    You can't have two attribute types with the same name. 
                        Qualified names - attribute name preceded by name of 
                        relation. (R1.id, R2.id, etc)

                    A relation can't be multiplied by itself unless a copy is 
                        made with different attribute names. Otherwise, you 
                        can't provide unique names.

        Union and intersect are associative; subtract is not.

            2. special operators
                a. select
                    Selects a subset of the tuples of a relation. Selects all 
                        attributes. (horizontal)

                    X1 = select S where city = "LA";
                    (original relation is S)

                    X2 = select S where status > 10;

                b. project
                    Selects a vertical subset of a relation. 

                    X3 = project S over city;

                    X3 has only one attribute, with tuples corresponding to 
                        each unique value of the attribute in the original 
                        relation.
                
                    X4 = project S over sname, status, city;

                c. join
                    Different types of join: 
                        i. equi-join
                            W = R1 equi-join R2 where R1.B = R2.E;
                            
                            Take first tuple in R1, check against each tuple 
                                in R2 individually. If condition true, 
                                concatenate the tuples; otherwise, ignore.

                            All attributes must appear in the result.
                
                            * Equi-join can be done by doing a multiplication 
                                and selecting from the resulting cartesian 
                                product. (TIMES, SELECT)

                        ii. natural join
                            W2 = R1 natural join R2;

                            No "where" condition necessary. Compares only 
                                attributes with exactly the same name in 
                                both relations. As many attributes you have 
                                with the same names will be involved in the 
                                equality check.

                            Only one copy of attributes with same name appear 
                                in the results. 

                            Only when all values match is the tuple saved to 
                                the result.

                        iii. equal join
                            W3 = R1 equal join R2 where R1.B = R2.E;
                                
                            Results will not have duplicated attributes. 
                            
                        iv. theta join
                            greater than join, less than join, GTE join, etc.

                        

                d. division
