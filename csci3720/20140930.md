=============

Subqueries
----------

# Get name of suppliers who ship parts w/ qty > 500. 

    select SNAME 
    from S, SP
    where SP.QTY > 500 AND 
          S.S# = SP.S#;

Note: Selecting from multiple relations, like above, no longer permitted. 

# Get name of suppliers w/ same status as supplier S1. 

    select SNAME 
    from S
    where STATUS = any 
          (select STATUS 
           from S
           where S# = "S1");

# Name of suppliers w/ shipment qty 300. 

    select SNAME
    from S
    where S# = any
          (select S#
           from SP
           where QTY = 300);

Doing a join without a subquery is awful for performance because it does the 
join first, resulting in huge numbers of records. 

# Get part name for parts shipped by S5. 

    select PNAME
    from P 
    where P# = any
          (select P# 
           from SP
           where S# = "S5");

Note: attribute after the where always same as the one being selected in the 
subquery. 

# Get color for parts having weight 22 and shipped by Jones. 

    select COLOR
    from P 
    where WEIGHT = 22 and 
          P# = any 
          (select P# 
           from SP
           where S# = any 
           (select S#
            from S
            where SNAME = "Jones"));

# Get number of suppliers in organization. (count() function)

    select count(*)
    from s;

# Get number of suppliers who live in London. 

    select count(*)
    from S
    where CITY = "London";

# Get quantity for part P1 shipped by S2 (sum() function)

    select sum(QTY) 
    from SP
    where P# = "P1" AND
          S# = "S2";

The result of the sum function might equal, say, 1500. 

The result of the function is a relation: 

            sum(QTY)
            --------
              1500

# Get average quantity shipped by Jones. 

    select avg(QTY) 
    from SP
    where S# = any 
          (select S#
           from S
           where SNAME = "Jones");

Other functions: max(), min()

# Calculate sum of qty for each S\#

    select S#, sum(QTY)
    from SP
    group by S#;

        S# | sum(QTY)
        -------------
        S1 |   200
        S2 |   300
        .. |   ...

Sorting: 

    select * 
    from SP
    order by S#;

Updating
--------

Two ways: 
# Update value, knowing its previous value. 
# Update value, w/o knowing previous value. 

Without knowing: 

    update P
    set COLOR = "yellow" 
    where P# = "P2";

Without knowing, multiple attribute values at once: 

    update P
    set COLOR = "yellow", 
        PNAME = "Jack"
    where P# = "P2";

Suppose you want to give every employee in a company a 5% raise. You need to 
know the current value. 

    update P 
    set WEIGHT = weight + 2;
    (where P# = ...)

# Update status of supplier S1 (add 5) and change name. 

    update S
    set STATUS = STATUS + 5, 
        SNAME = "Nelson"
    where S# = "S1";

Creating (inserting)
--------------------

Three ways: 
# Insert a tuple into S that does not have any null values
# Insert a tuple w/ null values
# Insert multiple tuples

No null value: 

    insert into P
    values("P7", "washer", "grey", "2", "Savannah");

    Can also write 'P(P#, PNAME, COLOR, WEIGHT, CITY)'. These don't have to be 
    in the same order they're in in the relation. DBMS can handle this. 

    Not needed if new attributes are already in the right order, though. 

Null values: 

    insert into P(P#, PNAME, CITY) 
    values("P10", "Jack", "Atlanta");

Multiple tuples: 

    insert into X(a) 
        select P#
        from SP
        where S# = "SP";

    If X has an attribute P# (same name), you don't have to specify the 
    attribute name.

Deleting
--------

    delete 
    from SP
    where P# = "P2";

    delete 
    from SP; 

    ^ Truncation. Keeps schema. 

    drop SP; 

    ^ Keeps nothing.
